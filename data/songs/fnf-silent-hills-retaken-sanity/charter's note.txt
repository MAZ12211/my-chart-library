What I like about the song?

- The cartony-like build up
- 30:31 the hold notes
- 40:56 the fast part compliments well with the inst
- 56:72 The guiter part with the hold notes
- 86:88 the melody
- 96:104 slightly faster notes (is it 16ths?)
- 118:120 the melody

What about the structure?

9:10 sounds like stairs?
14:15 trill part
